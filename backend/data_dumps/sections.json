    "description": "This course is designed to facilitate personal-professional growth and use of the self as a therapeutic tool by guiding students along the Jesuit academic path to become a professional nurse. Students are prepared to provide relationship-based care, to identify with the values of professional nursing, and to become effective members of the interprofessional health care team. Learning about the importance of self-care, compassion, and resilience, along with skills for communicating in health-care systems and negotiating conflicts, is highlighted. Small group seminars facilitated by an experienced nurse faculty allow students to share their own values, beliefs and experiences in a safe and supportive learning environment which facilitates their professional role acquisition.  Small group work involves active engagement, via guided discussion, simulated interviewing, role- play, role-modeling, dramatic enactments, and repeated skills-practice.   Course content is supported via assignments and classroom exploration of nursing theory and evidence associated with communication competencies and relationship-based care.",

Our class will also consider the efforts of governmental and non-governmental organizations to alleviate poverty. Through a final project, students will engage with course themes in St. Louis through an outreach experience.",

Organized around this central question, this course examines how cultural milieus, social structures, and historical contexts have shaped the thoughts, feelings, and desires of people living in different times and places. Have people always and everywhere felt anger? How does speaking different languages shape how we sense the world? Where Western psychiatric diagnoses are absent or insufficient, how is \u201cmental illness\u201d interpreted and experienced? How do unequal economic and political systems shape our psyches, and our very understanding of how the psyche operates? To examine the question of the relation between mind and world, this course puts psychological anthropology into conversation with social and cultural psychology, history, social theory, philosophy, and film.",

It takes as its point of departure a fundamental paradox: The globally connected economy has enabled the accumulation of unparalleled wealth, while at the same time, allowing basic human need to persist at a breathtaking scale. Through a range of texts and films, this class will discuss different ways of thinking about what poverty is, how it is experienced, justified and maintained in cities, and by whom. Our class will also consider the efforts of governmental and non-governmental organizations to alleviate poverty. Through a final project, students will engage with course themes in St. Louis through an outreach experience.",

We ask questions about why certain countries experience revolution, economic development, religious fundamentalism, stable democracy, ethnic conflict, famine, or effective judicial systems, among many topics. At an intuitive (and biological) level we know that there is something that makes the human inhabitants of the planet remarkably similar to one another. But at second glance, we are also incredibly diverse. In this class we will ponder this basic question of similarity and difference, and ask the following question: how do these similarities and differences impact the ways societies are governed?",

This has been especially true for women. This course explores connections between gender, religious belief, and social activism in the late twentieth-century and early twenty-first century. We examine faith traditions and activist mobilizations that connect\u2014and divide\u2014women and LGBTQ+ people around the world. Drawing from sources that include theology, history, journalism, and memoir, we will examine the spiritual underpinnings of a variety of approaches to social justice as well as the tangible work of local and transnational activist movements. We will inquire into the theological and activist interventions of women representing a variety of faiths, including Islam, Christianity, Indigenous spiritualties, and new religious movements.",

Students gain practical experience creating interactive maps and dashboards that communicate and interrogate spatial patterns of inequality effectively. By the end of the course, students are equipped with the skills to leverage GIS in their research and social justice efforts and have a deeper understanding of the spatial dimensions of inequality. This course is ideal for students in social sciences, public health, public policy, and similar areas, or anyone interested in the intersection of geography and social research.

We will also consider several sociological and practice-based texts to sharpen our instincts and improve our skills in supporting others through grief. We will learn about cultural rituals, social support systems, and the communal nature of grief. By the end of the course, we will have examined and reflected upon both our assumptions and the formations of our individual perspectives on the goodness of God and the goodness of grief.",

During the term of the co-op, students, along with their site supervisor/mentor, will jointly take an online, asynchronous professional development module offered by the Emerson Leadership Institute. Both the longer-term, immersive nature and the leadership module are geared for greater impact in developing students' professional skills. Through the use of journals and reflection papers, students will further discern the intersection of their academic journey and their workplace experience and how that enhances their understanding of acting with and for others.

Students will discover how computers can learn from examples and extract salient patterns hidden in large data sets. The course will introduce classification algorithms that predict discrete states for variables as well as regression algorithms that predict continuous values for variables. Attention will be given to both supervised and unsupervised settings in which (respectively) labeled training data is or is not available. Emphasis is placed on both the conceptual relationships between these different learning problems as well as the statistical models and computational methods used to employ those models.
